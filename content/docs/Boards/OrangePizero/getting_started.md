### **4. A USB to Serial Adapter**

To setup Orange Pi Zero  for the first time, you will need a USB to serial adapter as the Orange Pi Zero is running headless this means without graphical interface/output.
A adapter Board with TV Composite output is available but its only supporting a very low resolution thus not used in the getting started.
